    "Twitter (/ˈtwɪtər/) is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact
    with messages known as "tweets". Registered users can post, like, and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can
    only read them. Users access Twitter through its website interface, through Short Message Service (SMS) or its
    mobile-device application software ("app").[15] Twitter, Inc. is based in San Francisco, California, and has
    more than 25 offices around the world.[16] Tweets were originally restricted to 140 characters, but was doubled
    to 280 for non-Asian languages in November 2017."
