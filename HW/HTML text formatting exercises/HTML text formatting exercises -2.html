    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1998, Rowling sold the film rights of the first four Harry Potter books to Warner Bros. for a reported Â£1 million
        ($1,982,900).[177][178] Rowling demanded the principal cast be kept strictly British, nonetheless allowing for the
        inclusion of Irish actors such as the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and for casting of French and Eastern
        European actors in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where characters from the book are specified as such.[179]
        After many directors including Steven Spielberg, Terry Gilliam, Jonathan Demme, and Alan Parker were considered,
        Chris Columbus was appointed on 28 March 2000 as the director for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (titled
        "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" in the United States), with Warner Bros. citing his work on other family
        films such as Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire and proven experience with directing children as influences for their
        decision.[180]</p>
    
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After extensive casting, filming began in October 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios and in London itself, with
        production ending in July 2001.[181][182] Philosopher's Stone was released on 14 November 2001. Just three days
        after the film's release, production for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, also directed by Columbus, began.
        Filming was completed in summer 2002, with the film being released on 15 November 2002.[183] Daniel Radcliffe
        portrayed Harry Potter, doing so for all succeeding films in the franchise.</p>
